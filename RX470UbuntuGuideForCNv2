As far as I know bios flashing cannot be done in Linux.
I used the Windows 10 machine with Adrenalin 2019 edition 19.1.1 driver.

Please work with one card at a time.  

WARNING: The procedure may brick the graphics card!!!!
NOTE: If you have many graphics cards to flash and you are confident enough, you may flash multiple cards at at time.

I am including all the version numbers.  It may or may not work if the version
number(s) are different.
Plug in RX470 and power up Windows 10.
Start AMD/ATI ATIWinFlash 2.8.4 (https://www.techpowerup.com/download/ati-atiflash/)
Select RX470, enter Filename and press "Save" button.  (Example Filename: RX470OriginalBiosGPU1)

Start GPU-Z v2.16.0 and make note of Memory Type and save it to file RX470OirginalBiosMemTypeGPU1.rom where MemType is Micron,
Samsung, or Hynix...etc.
Save to file icon is next to "UEFI" checkbox.
Repeat the process with filename RX470ModifiedBiosMemTypeGPU1.rom (This file will be used in SRB Polaris Bios Editor)

Start SRBPolaris Bios Editor V3.5 (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1882656.0)
Click on "Open BIOS" button and select RX470ModifiedBiosMemTypeGPU1.rom.
Click on "Mem.Timings" Tab/Button to display Timings page.
Click on "PIMP MY STRAPS" blue button.  Make sure you see "Pimping successful" dialog box.
Click on "Save BIOS" button overwrite RX470ModifiedBiosMemTypeGPU1.rom.

Go back to already opened ATIFlash 2.8.4 application.
Click on "Load Image" button and select RX470ModifiedBiosMemTypeGPU1.rom and press "Program" button.
Repeat the process until all your cards are ready for Linux rig.

Note: I am saving the original bios using ATIFlash and GPU-Z so that you have two copies of bios just in case if you want to
re-flash to the original bios.


Install Ubuntu Linux OS 18.04.1 LTS.
Assumption: Ubuntu MATE 18.04.1 installed and network has been configured.
Install Ubuntu MATE and configure network.(If you don't know how, please google it.)
Assuming all commands are executed as a "root" user.  If you prefer, you may use sudo.

All commands are followed after "$"(for non-root user) "#"(for root user) character prompt.
And please do not get offended that I'm going through command by command.
I'm writing for the inexperienced user.

Set up ssh and root user
$ sudo su -
[sudo]  password for user jdoe: ********  <-- Enter your jdoe's password
# passwd
Enter new UNIX password: ********  <-- Enter your root's password here
Retype new UNIX password: ********  <-- Confirm your root's password here
passwd: password updated successfully
# exit
# logout
$ su -
Password: ********  <-- Enter your root's password that you have created above
Download amdgpu-pro drivers  and put them in /root/Downloads only if you are going
to use TeamRedMiner mining software.

Tested drivers:
amdgpu-pro-18.30-633530.tar.xz for Ubuntu 18.04.1
amdgpu-pro-18.50-708488-ubuntu-18.04.tar.xz for Ubuntu 18.04.1

URL: https://www.amd.com/en/support

Make sure that network has been configured and connected.
Download a VegaToolsNConfigs zip file from GitHub.
# cd
# unzip VegaToolsNConfigs-master.zip
# mv VegaToolsNConfigs-master VegaToolsNConfigs
# mv VegaToolsNConfigs /root/
If you clone the VegaToolsNConfigs, move the directory to /root/.
Move all the files from config, tools and PPTDIR folders to VegaToolsNConfigs folder.
# cd VegaToolsNConfigs
# mv config/* .
# mv tools/* .
# mv PPTDIR/* .
Make sure the scripts are runnable.
# chmod 770 *.sh

Do update
# apt-get update
Install ssh server
# apt-get install -y openssh-server
# perl -i.bak -npe 's/^PermitRootLogin/\#PermitRootLogin/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
# echo "PermitRootLogin yes" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# echo  "vm.nr_hugepages = 128" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
# reboot


Do update
# apt-get update

Install lm-sensors
# apt-get install -y lm-sensors 
# sensors-detect --auto
# reboot

Do update
# apt-get update
In my case amdgpu-pro drivers are in ~/Downloads directory.   Replace it with your own directory.
# cd ~/Downloads
Install version 18.30 or 18.50 at this time.
# tar -Jxvf amdgpu-pro-18.30-633530.tar.xz 
# cd amdgpu-pro-18.30-633530 
# ./amdgpu-pro-install -y --opencl=legacy
# reboot

Do update
# apt-get update
# cd /root/Downloads
# cd /etc/default
# mv grub grub.original
# cp grub.original grub
# perl -i.bak -npe 's/quiet splash/quiet splash amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xffffffff/g' grub
# cat grub | grep amdgpu 
# update-grub
Add GPUs after powering off
# poweroff

ADD ALL THE VIDEO CARDS HERE IF NECESSARY.

Restart the computer and log back into the system from console or from ssh terminal.

It is necessary to update during installation process.  Otherwise it may not work.
# apt-get update
Now run the miners:

TeamRedMiner
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5059817.0

TeamRedMiner: cd to where teamredminer executable is.  I usually use ~/git/teamred/ directory.
Single GPU
# ./teamredminer -a cnv8 -o stratum+tcp://pool.monero.hashvault.pro:7777 -u YOUR_WALLET_ID  -p  YOUR_RIG_NAME -d 0 --cn_config 8+7
Multiple GPUs
# ./teamredminer -a cnv8 -o stratum+tcp://pool.monero.hashvault.pro:7777 -u YOUR_WALLET_ID  -p  YOUR_RIG_NAME -d 0,1,2,3 --cn_config 8+7,8+7,8+7,8+7

If you want to use my rig monitor use the following.
# ./teamredminer -a cnv8 -o stratum+tcp://pool.monero.hashvault.pro:7777 -u YOUR_WALLET_ID  -p YOUR_RIG_NAME -d 0,1,2,3 --cn_config 8+7,8+7,8+7,8+7  2>&1 | tee ~/git/teamred/hashrate.log

Follow the steps in OptimalRunningSequencesForRX470.

HAPPY MINING...
