Assuming that you have done the next two tasks.

Install CenotOS(Minimal) to usb key. This should not take more than 15 minutes.
Configure network settings.

# mkdir ~/Downloads; mkdir ~/git

# yum update -y
# yum install pciutils
# echo  "vm.nr_hugepages = 128" >> /etc/sysctl.conf


Disable selinux:
# cd /etc/selinux/; sed -i 's/\(SELINUX\=\)\(.*\)/\1disabled/g' config
# cat /etc/selinux/config | grep disabled

Update grub:
# cd /etc/default
# mv grub grub.original
# cp grub.original grub
# sed -i 's/\(quiet\)/\1 amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xffffffff/g' grub
# cat grub | grep amdgpu 
# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

NOTE: You may use xmr-stak binar(ies) instead of teamreadminer binar(ies).
      As of xmr-stark 2.10.2 invalid resuls are being generated and losing hash rate at the pool.
      Replace teamredminer with xmr-stark in the guide, if you are using xmr-stak binar(ies).

Download VegaToolsNConfigs, teamredminer*.tgz and amdgpu-pro driver to ~/Downloads folder.

TeamRedMinerURL: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5059817.0
xmr-stak: https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak/releases/tag/2.10.2

Prepare TeamRedMiner:
# cd git
# cp ~/Downloads/teamredminer-v0.4.2-linux.tgz
# tar -xzvf teamredminer-v0.4.2-linux.tgz
# ln -s teamredminer-v0.4.2-linux teamred

Prepare xmr-stak
# cd git
# mkdir xmr-stak
# cd xmr-stak
# cp ~/Downloads/xmr-stak-linux-2.10.2-cpu_opencl-amd.tar.xz .
# tar -Jxvf xmr-stak-linux-2.10.2-cpu_opencl-amd.tar.xz

Install lm_sensors:
# yum install -y lm_sensors
# sensors-detect --auto

Install git and get VegaToolsNConfigs:
# yum install -y git
# git clone https://github.com/xmrminer01102018/VegaToolsNConfigs.git

# cd VegaToolsNConfigs
# mv README.md README.main
# mv config/* .
# mv tools/* .
# mv PPTDIR/* .
# mv rigmonitor/* .
# chmod 770 *.sh

# cd ~/Downloads/
# tar -Jxvf amdgpu-pro-18.50-725072-rhel-7.6.tar.xz 
# cd amdgpu-pro-18.50-725072-rhel-7.6
# ./amdgpu-pro-install -y --opencl=pal --headless

# poweroff

If you have not plugged in your GPU(s), plug all of them here and re-start the computer.

# yum update -y

# cd VegaToolsNConfigs
# ./getGPUStats.sh

If you do not see the GPU information, deinstall and reinstall amdgpu-pro driver as follows.
NOTE:  Most of the time, second try will work.

# /usr/bin/amdgpu-pro-uninstall -y
# cd ~/Downloads/
# cd amdgpu-pro-18.50-725072-rhel-7.6
# ./amdgpu-pro-install -y --opencl=pal --headless

# reboot

# cd VegaToolsNConfigs
# ./getGPUStats.sh

You should see the GPU information now.

Prepare GPU for the TeamRedMiner:
NOTE: All PPT from CNv1 and CNv2 should work for CNr and CNrwz
# ./setPPT.sh 0 V56PPT; ./setAMDGPUFanSpeed.sh -g 0 -s 70

Now run the TeamRedMiner or xmr-stak: 
# cd ~/git/teamred/ 
OR
# cd ~/git/xmr-stak

TeamRedMiner:
For Monero(XMR)
# ./teamredminer -a cnr -o stratum+tcp://pool.hashvault.pro:7777 -u YOUR_WALLET_ID  -p RIG_NAME -d 0 --cn_config 16+14

For GRAFT
# ./teamredminer -a cnv8_rwz -o stratum+tcp://pool.graft.hashvault.pro:7777 -u YOUR_WALLET_ID  -p RIG_NAME -d 0 --cn_config 16+14

xmr-stak: Enter appropriate values. Use cryptonight_r for XMR and cryptonight_v8_reversewaltz for GRAFT.

./xmr-stak

For running sequences, please see OptimalRunningSequencesForVegas.
And you can make ISO for the usb key installation and use it on many machines by makeing usb key bootable miner/OS(That's another write up).

HAPPY MINING...
