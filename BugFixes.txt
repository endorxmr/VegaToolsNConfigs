setAMDGPUFanSpeed.sh
In multiple GPU combination, the directory /sys/class/drm/card${gpunumber}/device/hwmon/hwmon${gpunumber} is not always true.
The directory colud be
/sys/class/drm/card0/device/hwmon/hwmon0
or
/sys/class/drm/card0/device/hwmon/hwmon1.
Fix: Instead of relying on ${gpunumber}, I used the find command to get the correct directory path.
