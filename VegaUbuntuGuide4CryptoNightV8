Install Ubuntu Linux OS 18.04.1 LTS or 16.04.5.
Assumption: Ubuntu MATE 18.04.1 installed and network has been configured.
Install Ubuntu MATE and configure network.(If you don't know how, please google it.)
Assuming all commands are executed as a "root" user.  If you prefer, you may use sudo.

All commands are followed after "$"(for non-root user) "#"(for root user) character prompt.
And please do not get offended that I'm going through command by command.
I'm writing for the inexperienced user.

Set up ssh and root user
$ sudo su -
[sudo]  password for user jdoe: ********  <-- Enter your jdoe's password
# passwd
Enter new UNIX password: ********  <-- Enter your root's password here
Retype new UNIX password: ********  <-- Confirm your root's password here
passwd: password updated successfully
# exit
# logout
$ su -
Password: ********  <-- Enter your root's password that you have created above
Download amdgpu-pro drivers  and put them in /root/Downloads only if you are going
to use cast-xmr 1.5.0+ miner
NOTE: the tar.xz file name is the same for amdgpu-pro 18.30 for Ubuntu 18.04.1 and Ubuntu 16.04.5
For Ubuntu MATE 18.04.1
amdgpu-pro-18.30-633530.tar.xz for Ubuntu 18.04.1 
or
amdgpu-pro-18.30-641594.tar.xz for Ubuntu 18.04.1

For Ubuntu MATE 16.04.5
amdgpu-pro-18.30-641594.tar.xz for Ubuntu 16.04.5

URL: https://www2.ati.com/drivers/

Make sure that network has been configured and connected.
Download a zip file from GitHub.
# cd
# unzip VegaToolsNConfigs-master.zip
# mv VegaToolsNConfigs-master VegaToolsNConfigs
# mv VegaToolsNConfigs /root/
If you clone the VegaToolsNConfigs, move the directory to /root/.
Move all the files from config, tools and PPTDIR folders to VegaToolsNConfigs folder.
# cd VegaToolsNConfigs
# mv config/* .
# mv tools/* .
# mv PPTDIR/* .
Make sure the scripts are runnable.
# chmod 770 *.sh

Copy automateVUG.sh from ROCm folder to VegaToolsNConfigs folder if you intend to
use xmrig-amd 2.8.1+ or xmr-stak 2.5.0+ and run the automatic process.
# cp ROCm/* . 
Make sure the scripts are runnable.
# chmod 770 *.sh
Edit automateVUG.sh and change MINER to your preferred miner and save it.
The default is XMRIGAMD.
MINER="XMRSTAK"
or
MINER="XMRIGAMD"

For automatic process just run autoConfigure.sh and skip the rest of the instruction below.
# ./autoConfigure.sh

Do update
# apt-get update
Install ssh server
# apt-get install -y openssh-server
# perl -i.bak -npe 's/^PermitRootLogin/\#PermitRootLogin/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
# echo "PermitRootLogin yes" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# echo  "vm.nr_hugepages = 128" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
# reboot


Do update
# apt-get update

Install lm-sensors
# apt-get install -y lm-sensors

For CAST-XMR ONLY
********************************************************************************
You can download cast-xmr from : http://www.gandalph3000.com/cast_xmr/linux/linux_version_of_cast-xmr-cryptonight-monero-miner-for-rx-vega-gpus/
In my case amdgpu-pro drivers are in ~/Downloads directory.   Replace it with your own directory.
# cd ~/Downloads
Install version 18.30 at this time. You can use  amdgpu-pro-18.30-641594 too.  Replace 633530 with 641594. 
# tar -Jxvf amdgpu-pro-18.30-633530.tar.xz 
# cd amdgpu-pro-18.30-633530 
# ./amdgpu-pro-install -y --opencl=pal
********************************************************************************

Do update
# apt-get update
# cd /root/Downloads
# cd /etc/default
# mv grub grub.original
# cp grub.original grub
# perl -i.bak -npe 's/quiet splash/quiet splash amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xffffffff/g' grub
# cat grub | grep amdgpu 
# update-grub
Add GPUs after powering off
# poweroff

ADD ALL THE VIDEO CARDS HERE.

Restart the computer and log back into the system from console or from ssh terminal.

It is necessary to update during installation process.  Otherwise it may not work.
# apt-get update

NOTE: IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO RUN THE SCRIPTS, JUST TYPE IN THE SCRIPT AND PRESS ENTER.
EXAMPLE:
./setGPUOC.sh
./setGPUOC.sh gpu_number_separated_by_comma %SCLK %MCLK
Example: Overclock GPU 0 with 8% gpu clock increase and 6% memory clock increase:
./setGPUOC.sh 0 8 6


Set fan speed to 80%.  If you do not know your gpu numbers do the following.
They should match the number of gpus in your system.
# ls /sys/kernel/debug/dri/
Use only single digit numbers only.  Ignore the triple digits if they exist.
And list each number.  You only want the gpu number with amdgpu in most cases.
# ls /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0
# ls /sys/kernel/debug/dri/1
# ls /sys/kernel/debug/dri/2
...etc

NOTE:  The following steps are to be performed after every reboot/restart.

Make note of initial RPM
# sensors | grep pci -A 6
In this example, only one gpu is there at gpu number 0.
If you have more than one, use "-g 0,1", "-g 0,1,2", "-g 0,1,2,3"...etc
Set fan speed to 80%. 
# ./setAMDGPUFanSpeed.sh -g 0 -s 80

Now recheck the RPM
# sensors | grep pci -A 6

Run the GPU info script first to make sure that you can see the Vega card and follow the directions.

# ./getGPUStats.sh

After you get it working, run the setSMClockVoltages.sh file with your Vega card .data file.

Example: If you have XFX Vega64 card in card0 run the following.  Clock and voltage file - *.data_OC8_7.
Specific card *.data_OC8_7 files are provided.  If your card is not in the list, use any *V56*.data_OC8_7 or *V64*.data_OC8_7
and tweak it.  VegaFE does not have that problem.  So far there are no third party VegaFEs. 

Example of single GPU
# ./setSMClockVoltages.sh 0 XFXVega64.data_OC8_7 skip

Optional: Example for multiple GPUs gpu1 gpu5 gpu6
# ./setSMClockVoltages.sh 1,5,6 XFXVega64.data_OC8_7 skip

Now overclock the gpu 0 accordig to OC number in clock and voltage file name.

# ./setGPUOC.sh 0 8 7

Now run the miner

# cd git/xmrig-amd/build
# ./xmrig-amd

You may skip the next step if the power usage is still optimal after the reboot.
Check it with getGPUStats.sh.

Apply PPT to gpu 0.  Use V64PPT for Vega 64 and Vega FE.  Use V56PPT for Vega 56.
# ./setPPT.sh 0 V56PPT

After PPT is applied, the fan will stop.  Restart the fan speed again. 
# ./setAMDGPUFanSpeed.sh -g 0 -s 80

Now monitor your gpu(s) in another terminal(s)

# ./getGPUStats.sh

HAPPY MINING...

ps.

CryptoNightV8.
