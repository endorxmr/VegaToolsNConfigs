NOTE: You can ignore the guide referencing OC numbers.
      I left most of the config file names the same but change the OC value to
      get the optimal value. If the OC values in the file name and comannd are
      different they are "intentional".

For Samsung V56 use the following steps for optimal hash rate.
Don't pay attention to befor and after values in OC.
The number may not change but you will definitely see the hash rate change.
Remember to replace the gpu sequence with your own.

STEP1:
./setAMDGPUFanSpeed.sh -g 0 -s 70
./setSMClockVoltages.sh 0 XFXV56S.data_OC9_8 skip
./setGPUOC.sh 0 9 8

Start xmrig-amd in another terminal and let it settle down about 3-5 minutes.
If you see zero hash rate, don't panic.  Do STEP2.
TIP: If you are experiencing the GPU(s) shutting down the machine after runnng
xmrig-amd at this stage, restart it and run STEP1 and STEP2 together befor
running xmrig-amd.

STEP2:
./setPPT.sh 0 V56PPT
./setAMDGPUFanSpeed.sh -g 0 -s 70

Wait about 2-3 minutes more and do the last step.

STEP3:
./setSMClockVoltages.sh 0 XFXV56S.data_P7P3OC8_7 skip
./setGPUOC.sh 0 8 7


For Hynix V56 use the following steps for optimal hash rate.
Don't pay attention to befor and after values in OC.
The number may not change but you will definitely see the hash rate change.
Remember to replace the gpu sequence with your own.

./setSMClockVoltages.sh 0,1 MSIV56H.data_OC8_7 skip
./setGPUOC.sh 0,1 7 6
./setPPT.sh 0 V56PPT
./setPPT.sh 1 V56PPT
./setAMDGPUFanSpeed.sh -g 0,1 -s 70



For V64 use the following steps for optimal hash rate.
Don't pay attention to befor and after values in OC.
The number may not change but you will definitely see the hash rate change.
Remember to replace the gpu sequence with your own.

STEP1:
./setAMDGPUFanSpeed.sh -g 0,1 -s 70
./setSMClockVoltages.sh 0,1 XFXVega64S.data_2KOC9_7 skip
./setGPUOC.sh 0,1 9 7

Start xmrig-amd in another terminal and let it settle down about 3-5 minutes.
If you see zero hash rate, don't panic.  Do STEP2.
TIP: If you are experiencing the GPU(s) shutting down the machine after runnng
xmrig-amd at this stage, restart it and run STEP1 and STEP2 together befor
running xmrig-amd.

STEP2:
./setPPT.sh 0 V64PPT
./setPPT.sh 1 V64PPT
./setAMDGPUFanSpeed.sh -g 0,1 -s 70

Wait about 2-3 minutes more and do the last step.

STEP3:
./setSMClockVoltages.sh 0,1 XFXVega64S.data_P7P3_OC9_7 skip
./setGPUOC.sh 0,1 9 7



For FE use the following steps for optimal hash rate.
Don't pay attention to befor and after values in OC.
The number may not change but you will definitely see the hash rate change.
Remember to replace the gpu sequence with your own.

STEP1:
./setAMDGPUFanSpeed.sh -g 0,1 -s 70
./setSMClockVoltages.sh 0,1 VegaFE.data_OC9_8 skip
./setGPUOC.sh 0,1 9 7

Start xmrig-amd in another terminal and let it settle down about 3-5 minutes.
Do STEP2.
TIP: If you are experiencing the GPU(s) shutting down the machine after runnng
xmrig-amd at this stage, restart it and run STEP1 and STEP2 together befor
running xmrig-amd.

STEP2:
./setPPT.sh 0 V64PPT
./setPPT.sh 1 V64PPT
./setAMDGPUFanSpeed.sh -g 0,1 -s 70
