Install Ubuntu Linux OS 18.04.1 LTS or 16.04.5.
Assumption: Ubuntu MATE 18.04.1 installed and network has been configured.
Install Ubuntu MATE and configure network.(If you don't know how, please google it.)
Assuming all commands are executed as a "root" user.  If you prefer, you may use sudo.

All commands are followed after "$"(for non-root user) "#"(for root user) character prompt.
And please do not get offended that I'm going through command by command.
I'm writing for the inexperienced user.

Set up ssh and root user
$ sudo su -
[sudo]  password for user jdoe: ********  <-- Enter your jdoe's password
# passwd
Enter new UNIX password: ********  <-- Enter your root's password here
Retype new UNIX password: ********  <-- Confirm your root's password here
passwd: password updated successfully
# exit
# logout
$ su -
Password: ********  <-- Enter your root's password that you have created above
Download amdgpu-pro drivers  and put them in /root/Downloads. 
NOTE: the tar.xz file name is the same for amdgpu-pro 18.30 for Ubuntu 18.04.1 and Ubuntu 16.04.5.  If you are installing 18.40 or 18.50 drivers, use them instead of 18.30 drivers below.

For Ubuntu MATE 18.04.1
amdgpu-pro-18.30-633530.tar.xz for Ubuntu 18.04.1 
or
amdgpu-pro-18.30-641594.tar.xz for Ubuntu 18.04.1

For Ubuntu MATE 16.04.5
amdgpu-pro-18.30-641594.tar.xz for Ubuntu 16.04.5

URL: https://www2.ati.com/drivers/

Make sure that network has been configured and connected.
Download a zip file from GitHub.
# cd
# unzip VegaToolsNConfigs-master.zip
# mv VegaToolsNConfigs-master VegaToolsNConfigs
# mv VegaToolsNConfigs /root/
If you clone the VegaToolsNConfigs, move the directory to /root/.
Move all the files from config, tools and PPTDIR folders to VegaToolsNConfigs folder.
# cd VegaToolsNConfigs
# mv config/* .
# mv tools/* .
# mv PPTDIR/* .
Make sure the scripts are runnable.
# chmod 770 *.sh

Do update
# apt-get update
Install ssh server
# apt-get install -y openssh-server
# perl -i.bak -npe 's/^PermitRootLogin/\#PermitRootLogin/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
# echo "PermitRootLogin yes" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# echo  "vm.nr_hugepages = 128" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
# reboot


Do update
# apt-get update

Install lm-sensors
# apt-get install -y lm-sensors 
# sensors-detect --auto
# reboot

If you are going to use TeamRedMiner, skip to "For TeamRedMiner ONLY".

NOTE: You may have to repeat the xmrig-amd and  xmr-stak processes for each type of Vega cards.
If you have those different types of cards in the same rig/computer make sure to match the
cache files properly in the later steps.  This process is only for one Vega 56 or one Vega 64 or one Vega FE.

Do update
# apt-get update
In my case amdgpu-pro drivers are in ~/Downloads directory.   Replace it with your own directory.
# cd ~/Downloads
Install version 18.30 or 18.40 or 18.5 at this time.
# tar -Jxvf amdgpu-pro-18.30-633530.tar.xz 
# cd amdgpu-pro-18.30-633530 
# ./amdgpu-pro-install -y --opencl=pal
# reboot

Do update
# apt-get update
# apt-get install git build-essential cmake libuv1-dev libmicrohttpd-dev libssl-dev -y
# cd; mkdir git
# cd git

For xmrig-amd 2.14.0+ 
# git clone https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig-amd.git
#cd /root/git/xmrig-amd/ 
# mkdir build; cd build; cmake -DSTRICT_CACHE=OFF ..; make 

For xmr-stak 2.10.2+
# git clone https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak.git 
# cd /root/git/xmr-stak/
# mkdir build; cd build; cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-march=native -O3" -DOpenCL_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include -DOpenCL_LIBRARY=/opt/amdgpu-pro/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libOpenCL.so.1 -DCUDA_ENABLE=OFF .. 

Now copy your config file(s) (xmrig-amd:config.json or xmr-stak:amd.txt/pool.txt/config.txt).
Or you can use the already optimized config files under config folder.
NOTE: Do not forget to change your wallet ID and password.


For TeamRedMiner ONLY
********************************************************************************
In my case amdgpu-pro drivers are in ~/Downloads directory.   Replace it with your own directory.
# cd ~/Downloads
Install version 18.30 or 18.40 or 18.50 at this time. 
# tar -Jxvf amdgpu-pro-18.30-633530.tar.xz 
# cd amdgpu-pro-18.30-633530 
# ./amdgpu-pro-install -y --opencl=pal
********************************************************************************


Do update
# apt-get update
# cd /root/Downloads
# cd /etc/default
# mv grub grub.original
# cp grub.original grub
# perl -i.bak -npe 's/quiet splash/quiet splash amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xffffffff/g' grub
# cat grub | grep amdgpu 
# update-grub
Add GPUs after powering off
# poweroff

ADD ALL THE VIDEO CARDS HERE IF NECESSARY.

Restart the computer and log back into the system from console or from ssh terminal.

It is necessary to update during installation process.  Otherwise it may not work.
# apt-get update
Now run the miners:

TeamRedMiner: cd to where teamredminer executable is.  I usually use ~/git/teamred/ directory.
Single GPU
# ./teamredminer -a cnv8 -o stratum+tcp://pool.monero.hashvault.pro:7777 -u YOUR_WALLET_ID  -p  YOUR_RIG_NAME -d 0 --cn_config 16+14
Multiple GPUs
# ./teamredminer -a cnv8 -o stratum+tcp://pool.monero.hashvault.pro:7777 -u YOUR_WALLET_ID  -p  YOUR_RIG_NAME -d 0,1 --cn_config 16+14,16+14

If you want to use my rig monitor use the following.
# ./teamredminer -a cnv8 -o stratum+tcp://pool.monero.hashvault.pro:7777 -u YOUR_WALLET_ID  -p YOUR_RIG_NAME -d 0 --cn_config 16+14  2>&1 | tee /var/log/hashrate.log

XMRIG-AMD:
# cd ~/git/xmrig-amd/build
Now run the miner
# ./xmrig-amd

XMR-STAK:
# cd ~/git/xmr-stak/build
Run the miner.
# bin/xmr-stak

NOTE:  The following steps are to be performed after every reboot/restart.
       OR - follow the steps in OptimalRunningSequencesForVegas.

Make note of initial RPM
# sensors | grep pci -A 6
In this example, only one gpu is there at gpu number 0.
If you have more than one, use "-g 0,1", "-g 0,1,2", "-g 0,1,2,3"...etc
Set fan speed to 80%. 
# ./setAMDGPUFanSpeed.sh -g 0 -s 80

Now recheck the RPM
# sensors | grep pci -A 6

Run the GPU info script first to make sure that you can see the Vega card and follow the directions.

# ./getGPUStats.sh

After you get it working, run the setSMClockVoltages.sh file with your Vega card .data file.

Example: If you have XFX Vega64 card in card0 run the following.  Clock and voltage file - *.data_OC8_7.
Specific card *.data_OC8_7 files are provided.  If your card is not in the list, use any *V56*.data_OC8_7 or *V64*.data_OC8_7
and tweak it.  VegaFE does not have that problem.  So far there are no third party VegaFEs. 

Example of single GPU
# ./setSMClockVoltages.sh 0 XFXVega64.data_OC8_7 skip

Optional: Example for multiple GPUs gpu1 gpu5 gpu6
# ./setSMClockVoltages.sh 1,5,6 XFXVega64.data_OC8_7 skip

Now overclock the gpu 0 accordig to OC number in clock and voltage file name.

# ./setGPUOC.sh 0 8 7

Now run the miner

# cd git/xmrig-amd/build
# ./xmrig-amd

You may skip the next step if the power usage is still optimal after the reboot.
Check it with getGPUStats.sh.

Apply PPT to gpu 0.  Use V64PPT for Vega 64 and Vega FE.  Use V56PPT for Vega 56.
# ./setPPT.sh 0 V56PPT

After PPT is applied, the fan will stop.  Restart the fan speed again. 
# ./setAMDGPUFanSpeed.sh -g 0 -s 80

Now monitor your gpu(s) in another terminal(s)

# ./getGPUStats.sh

HAPPY MINING...

ps.
Checkout OptimalRunningSequencesForVegas file for running different GPUs under
CNr and CNrwz.
